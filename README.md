The task should be:
Retreive data from specific website which we will give you later.

• We will give you a link where dropdown menu will appear
• Select keyword from dropdown menu one by one
• There is a list of results will appear, you have to click "pay charges" button to proceed to next page
• In the next page, you have to fetch all the data in csv/excel file
• Make Separate csv/excel for each drop down & a combined file for all.

If anyone can make a crawler or any script using Python or JavaScript then it will be good.

We will also give you a reference video and link for better understanding.
