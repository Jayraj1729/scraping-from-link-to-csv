the script requires following dependendies

import time
import xlsxwriter
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

A nested for loop is used 
	~the outer loop will iterate through the dropdown options
	~the inner loop will click on the pay charges for each table entry

from the pry charges page the details is scraped with the help of muliple for loops in case the html structure was repeating and by variable declaration for exception cells and finally a single list is made 
this list is appended to the excel sheet and the loop goes on to the next row now.....

For the rest of the websites just change the url and run the script.......
